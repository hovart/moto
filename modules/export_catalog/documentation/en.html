  <h3>Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>
  This module allows you to export your catalog in CSV format. It supports multiple exports and planning by cron.
</p>
<p>
  This module works as follows: You define one or more <a href="#model">export models</a> and as many <a href="#scheduled">scheduled exports</a> as you want.
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>

  <h3><span id="model">Export models</span></span></h3>
</div>
<p>
  An export model defines the datas to export and how the generated file will be structured.
</p>
<p>
  The aim of an export model is to generate an CSV file. A CSV file consists of any number of records (here the products), one by line; each record consists of fields (here named columns), separated by some other character or string, most commonly a literal comma or semicolon.
</p>
<h4>Model name</h4>
<p>
  You can create as many export models as you want therefore choose an appropriate name is a good idea for easy retrieval.
</p>
<h4>File structure</h4>
<h5><span id="columns">Columns</span></h5>
<p>
  Select the datas you want to exports. Use the (+) button to add a column below the current one and the (-) button to delete the current column.
</p>
<h6><span id="field_value">Value</span></h6>
<p>
  Each column has a value, they are computed at the time of export.
</p>
<p>
  A special value "Fixed value" is independant of the product and can be anything you want.
</p>
<h6><span id="field_title">Title</span></h6>
<p>
  This column appears only if you activate the option <a href="#header">Add header line</a>. Indicate the names of the columns that will appear at the top of the generated file.
</p>
<h6><span id="field_decoration">Decoration</span></h6>
<p>
  This column appears only if you selected the option <a href="#decoration">Columns decoration</a>. Enter here the text to be inserted before and after the calculated values.
</p>
<h5><span id="filename">Filename</span></h5>
<p>
  Name of the generated file. It can be a fixed value like "catalog.csv" or a computed one like "catalog_%Y-%m-%d.csv".
</p>

  The following characters are recognized and will be replaced&#160;:

  <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p>
  <a href="/wiki/Samdha:faq" title="Samdha:faq">Frequently Asked Questions for all Samdha modules</a>
</p>
<h4>What is a CSV File?</h4>
<p>
  A CSV file consists of any number of records (here the products), one by line; each record consists of fields (here named columns), separated by some other character or string, most commonly a literal comma or semicolon.
</p>
<p>
  CSV is a common, relatively simple file format that is widely supported by consumer, business, and scientific applications. Among its most common uses is moving tabular data between programs that natively operate on incompatible (often proprietary and/or undocumented) formats. This works because so many programs support some variation of CSV at least as an alternative import/export format.
</p>
<h4><span id="open_csv">How to read a CSV file?</span></h4>
<p>
  (from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001357.htm">http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001357.htm</a>)
</p>
<p>
  A CSV file can be opened in any program, however, for most users a CSV file is best viewed through a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel, Open Office Calc or Google Docs.
</p>
<p>
  Tip: If you do not have a spreadsheet program installed on your computer consider using an online Spreadsheet such as Google Docs or a free Spreadsheet program.
</p>
<h5>Microsoft Excel</h5>
<p>
  If Microsoft Excel has been installed on the computer, by default CSV files should open automatically in Excel when the file icon is double-clicked. If you are getting an Open With prompt when opening the CSV file, choose Microsoft Excel from the available programs to open the file with.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively you can open Microsoft Excel and click File, Open, and select the .CSV file. If the file is not listed make sure to change the file type to be opened to Text files (*.prn, *.txt, *.csv).

</p>
<h5>Open/Free Office Calc</h5>
<p>
  If Open Office has been installed on the computer, by default CSV files should open automatically in Calc when the file icon is double-clicked. If you are getting an Open With prompt when opening the CSV file, choose Open office Calc from the available programs to open the file with.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively you can open Open Office Calc and click File, Open, and select the .CSV file.

</p>
<h5>Google Docs</h5>

  Open Google Docs, Click the Upload icon, Files, and browse to the directory containing the .CSV file. If an Upload settings window appears check the Convert documents, presentations, spreadsheets, and drawings to the corresponding Google Docs format checkbox and click Start upload.

<h4>The price comparator X need some arbritary columns. How to deal with it&#160;?</h4>
<p>
  Most of the time, price comparators need a category ID that is different that yours, like '15423' for Pet food or 'AZ23' for Computer accessories.
</p>
<p>
  You can deal with it using the Prestashop products features. Create a feature 'Comparator X category' (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS15/A+Look+Inside+the+Catalog#ALookInsidetheCatalog-Features">more informations</a>) and complete your products details with this feature (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS15/Adding+Products+and+Product+Categories#AddingProductsandProductCategories-ConfiguringProductFeatures">more informations</a>). Then in your export model, <a href="#columns">include the feature</a> 'Comparator X category'.
</p>
<p>
  If you don't want to display that feature on your shop, you can read this&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/174934-solved-hide-features-or-data-sheet-in-product-description/">http://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/174934-solved-hide-features-or-data-sheet-in-product-description/</a>
